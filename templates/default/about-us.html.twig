						<span class="text-last">Namdev Infratech</span>
						to better represent what we do today. What started in
						<strong>2003</strong>
						as a simple material supply business has grown into a complete solution provider for interior design, architecture, and construction. From handling
						<strong>25 tonnes</strong>
						back then to managing
						<strong>400 tonnes</strong>
						per month now, we’ve come a long way.
						<br/>
						Over the years, we’ve learned a lot about the challenges
						<span class="fst-italic text-last">designers, architects, and contractors</span>
						face, and we’ve adapted to meet their needs. With services like
						<span class="fst-italic text-last">custom fabrication, laser cutting, HR plate cutting, and more</span>, our new name reflects our commitment to providing innovative, reliable solutions that help turn their ideas into reality.</p>

					<h2 class="text-last fw-bold content mb-3">About Namdev Infratech</h2>
					<p class="text-secondary content">What started as a small material supply business has grown into a trusted,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															multifunctional center serving diverse industries. With over two decades of
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														experience, we’ve witnessed the challenges professionals face in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														procuring structural materials and related services. That’s where we step
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														in—bridging the gap between designers, architects, and contractors to
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														turn their vision into reality with precision and reliability.</p>
					<p class="text-secondary content">
						Our journey began in 2003, driven by the vision of our founder, Bajrang Lal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													Didwania, to contribute meaningfully to the core industries of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													economy. From supplying just 25 tonnes of material in our early days, we
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													now handle 400 tonnes per month, supporting projects across interior
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	design, architecture, construction, and beyond.</p>

					<p class="text-secondary content">

						But we don’t just supply materials—we create solutions. With expertise in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												custom fabrication, laser cutting, HR plate cutting, and precision
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												engineering components, we ensure that every project gets the right
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												material, right service, and the right execution.</p>
					<p class="text-secondary content">At Namadev Infratech, we don’t just sell steel—we build trust,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												craftsmanship, and lasting partnerships.</p>
